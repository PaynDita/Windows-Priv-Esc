NOTE:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Interactive vs. Non-Interactive

    The Batch/Netcat Method (Non-Interactive): This is usually required when you are executing commands through a web shell (like an ASPX or PHP shell) or a "blind" SQL injection. In those environments, you can't "talk" to a new process,
so you have to tell PrintSpoofer to run a batch file that "calls home" to your Kali machine using Netcat.
    The -i Method (Interactive): Because you already had a functional Command Prompt or PowerShell session open on the target, PrintSpoofer was able to use the -i (Interactive) flag. This flag tells the tool to "hijack" your current terminal 
window and redirect the input/output of the new SYSTEM process into your current screen.

2. When to use each approach
Method
	Use Case	Requirement
Direct -i -c cmd	When you have a working terminal/RDP/SSH session.	A stable interactive console.
Batch File / Netcat	When you have a "Web Shell" (IIS/Tomcat) or a restricted remote execution.	A listener (nc -lvnp) on your attacker machine.
PrintSpoofer is a tool used for local privilege escalation on Windows systems. The -i flag allows for interactive use when a stable command-line session is available. This differs from methods involving batch files and netcat, which are typically used 
in scenarios where an interactive shell is not readily available, such as through a web shell or other forms of limited remote execution. Understanding the different methods helps in determining the appropriate approach based on the specific access 
and environment on the target system. The PrintSpoofer GitHub documentation provides further details on its usage.
